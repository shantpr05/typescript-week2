### TypeScript Homework
Practice Based on Class Code
Complete each task in a .ts file (create a repo and branch it to: "week2 and branch again to
typescript). Choose at least one assignment per skill.

Skill 1: Typed Variables & Functions
Student Profile
Declare three variables to represent a student profile: name (string), age (number), and
isEnrolled (boolean). Then write an arrow function called describeStudent that takes a name and
age and returns a string like: "Michiel is 47 years old."
Log the result to the console.
Greeting with Options
Write an arrow function called formatGreeting that:
Takes a name: string parameter
Takes an optional formal?: boolean parameter
Returns "Good day, <name>." if formal is true, otherwise "Hi <name>!"
Call the function twice: once with formal set to true , and once without providing it at all.
Skill 2: Arrays & Array Methods (map / filter)
Doubling Ages
Create a typed array ages: number[] with at least 5 values. Use .map() to create a new array called
agesInFiveYears where every value is increased by 5. Log both arrays.
Filtering Names
Create a typed array names: string[] with at least 6 names. Use .filter() to create a new array
shortNames containing only names with 4 or fewer letters. Log the result.
Challenge (optional) Combined Transformation
Create a typed array scores: number[] with at least 8 values between 0 and 100. Using .filter()
and .map() together:
1. Keep only scores that are 50 or above (passing scores)
2. Convert each passing score into a letter grade string ( "A" , "B" , "C" , etc. and you decide the
cutoffs)
Log the final array of letter grades. Bonus: also log how many students failed, using .filter() and
.length .
Skill 3: Interfaces
Book Interface
Define an interface called Book with properties: title: string , author: string , and pages:
number . Create one object that and log its title .
Nested & Optional Properties
Define an interface Address with city: string and an optional postalCode?: string . Define an
interface Person that has name: string , age: number , and address: Address . Create two
Person objects, one with a postalCode and one without. Log the city of each person.
Challenge (optional) Interface with a Typed Function
Define an interface Movie with id: number , title: string , rating: number , and genres:
string[] . Create an array movies: Movie[] with at least 4 movies. Write a typed function
getMoviesByGenre(movies: Movie[], genre: string): Movie[] that returns only the movies
containing that genre in their genres array. Call the function and log the titles of the matching movies.
Skill 4: Chaining Array Methods on Interface Data
Filter Only
Using the Product interface style from class (id , name , price , tags), create an array of at least
5 products. Use .filter() to find all products priced under 1000. Log the result.
Filter + Map
Using the same Product array, chain .filter() and .map() to produce a list of just the names of
all products tagged "work" . Log the result.
Challenge (optional) Filter + Map + Join
Using the same 
Product array, write a single chained expression (like the 
example from class) that:
1. Filters products with more than one tag
2. Maps them to a string in the format 
"<name> ($<price>)"
3. Joins the results into one comma-separated string
Log the final string with a descriptive label, e.g. `"Multi-tag
